Project Specification of Blog Application:
Create a blogging application that allows users to do the following:
- register an account:
	- create a form register.pug
	- create a app.post in app
- login
	- create a app.post
	- create a form login.pug
- logout
	- create an input button that sets the session to logged of

Once logged in, a user should be able to:
- create a post
	- create a app.post
	- create a form createPost.pug
- view a list of their own posts
	- create a app.get
	- create a posts.pug that shows all the posts of the user
- view a list of everyone's posts
	- create a app.get
	- create a allPosts.pug that shows all posts of all users
	- or that shows all posts in posts.pug instead of only the user's posts
- view a specific post, including the comments people have made about it
	- create an app.get that gets a specific post with comments on that posts
- leave a comment on a post
	- create a form beneath a post so that people can react on it
	- render posts beneath posts

Prior to coding, determine the following:
- your tables: what columns will they have? How will they connect to one another?
	- create a table called users
	- create a table called posts
	- Create a table called comments
	- One user has many posts
	- One post has one user
	- One post has many comments
	- One comment has one post
- make a diagram showing the relationships between tables.
- your routes: what routes should you have? What should each route do?
Once you are done designing your application, then proceed with coding.
